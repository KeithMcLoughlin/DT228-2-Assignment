2nd Year assignment 1 - creating visualizations for a dataset using Processing

I'm going to be making visualizations for a dataset of the top grossing movies each year from 1935 - 2015. 
The data I'm going to be working with for these movies include their budgets, ratings, genre, runtimes and obviously their worldwide gross.
I'm hoping to create visualizations that will show how much the movie industry has grown and how the other fields have been affected over the years such as increased budgets for big hit movies.
I also want to answer some questions, such as "do audiences prefer long movies?" and "does it appear that a budget is affected by the genre?", by making comparisons between the fields.

I'm planning on doing a menu where you can choose from simple trend graphs of each field of the data, comparisons of the data represented by bar and area graphs and
a top 10's section where you can see the top 10 movies in relation to each field. I want to create my own visualization for the top 10 (top grossing) longest movies
where I could use the length of a roll of film to represent the runtime of the movie.

Advanced Features:
Animations I was thinking of doing include those rolls of film rolling out and an animated film projector which displays the number 1 spot in the top 10's section.
I would like to read in the data into a class.

This is what my main menu screen looks like and all other menus are similar to this one

The first option allows you to see each field as a trend graph, bar chart or area graph. It also highlights the point for the trend graph while displaying the title of that movie

The second option shows some comparisons such as:

Budget - Gross as a comparison trend graph

critic - audience as a comparison bar chart

genre - budget/gross as a text graph which calculates the size of the text in relation to its average

when you hover over the text it makes it bigger so its more readable and also displays the average beside the mouse

audience - runtime as a scatter plot

The final option displays the top 10 of each field
